# Features

## Live feed

- Live feed display a list of comments
- Comments are posted by App users directly on live feed or as comment of a post.
- Comments of post could be promoted to live feed by admin.
- A comment include:
  - description
  - (picture|media ???)
  - (link)
  - (postId) // when from post
- When promoted, comment include a link (label + url) to post source
  - should be improved, at the moment we add a itemId property on comment (same value of postId from original comment but rename it to not fetch the comment on post). Unique way we've find to preserve the navigationHistory and transition but not represent a generic solution for external links.
- Each comment could be deleted by its owner and admin.
- Each user is defined by:
  - first_name
  - last_name
  - (picture)
  - email
- Admin can respond by email to a comment
- Comments could be published = {true|false} by admin
- By default all comments.published == true if admin
  - default commment.published if user should be customizable by app
- Admin can filter comments by published property
- Admin can toggle published property
- User can react once to comment by Like/Clap, and discard its reaction
- User should be notified by a visual marker when new post is available since its last view.
- When promoted the comment is copied to appear o live feed
  - comment's post have a postId propery to identify them
- Add actions on left side of sliding-item: promote, remove, hide/show
  - should be improved, at the moment it's the best solution to not conflict with swipeable tabs. Another option could be a 3 dots button to show actions menu (like youtube).

## Image optimization

## User authentication and

## Image gallery
The Ionic image gallery is a classic pattern used in many applications which need to display any kind of grid with pictures or photos. 
For the image gallery. We can make use of the [ion-slides](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/components/slides/Slides/) component, and the [Riron/ionic-img-viewer](https://github.com/Riron/ionic-img-viewer) component which helps us to display a selected picture in fullscreen with zooming options.

## Multi-language
  [ngx-translate](http://www.ngx-translate.com/) is an internationalization library for Angular 2+. It lets you define translations for your content in different languages and switch between them easily.
  We've followed 
  - [Ionic 3 | Translate and Localize Your App With ngx-translate](https://www.gajotres.net/ionic-2-internationalize-and-localize-your-app-with-angular-2/)
  - [ionicframewokr docs: Using ngx-translate](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developer-resources/ng2-translate/)
    - this doc is outdated, continue using `HttpModule` (deprecated) instead of `HttpClientModule`.

Ionic v3 is compatible with `@ngx-translate/http-loader@2.0.1` and `@ngx-translate/core@9.1.1`, upper versions require angular 6. Check breaking changes on changelog of these projects for more details.

Should save selected language on App, and load it when launch.

For unit testing we've tried implementation based on [example providing from ngx-translate repo](https://github.com/ngx-translate/example/blob/master/src/app/app.component.spec.ts), but it was not successful. An extensive [thread](https://github.com/ngx-translate/core/issues/636) about unit testing take place on github repo of the project.

## Handle dates and time with ngx-moment

[ngx-moment](https://github.com/urish/ngx-moment) provides [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) pipes for Angular.
